TEX2IM 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tex2im is a simple tool that converts LaTeX formulas into high resolution
pixmap graphics for inclusion in text processors or presentations. I
encountered the problem that the formulas generated by the editors of common
office packages usually were the ugliest part of my scientific presentations;
on the other hand I didn't want to use latex for my transparencies (I'm aware 
of the slitex and foiltex packages, nevertheless I consider them to be for
masochists). EPS import can be nice, but commonly you get either display or 
printing problems. Additionally I doesn't want to rewrite all my formulas
which are already prepared in latex. So I wrote tex2im.

With tex2im you can write files containing only the formula in latex mathmode
and transform them to many different graphic formats. latex2html can do
something similar, but only on whole documents. This is the direct solution.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8: Support for non-formula mode and eps-graphics, bugfix for eqnarray formulas
Version 1.7: Tex2im can now process multiple files
Version 1.6: Removed necessity of generating an input file
Version 1.5: Transparency support
Version 1.4: Support for extra header lines and user specific default settings
Version 1.3: Fixed incompabilities with older versions of bash and convert
Version 1.2: Fixed tempfile problems on Redhat & Solaris
Version 1.1: Added color support
Version 1.0: Initial release


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's play around in the examples directory. Just type:

> tex2im examples/example1.tex

And you'll get a nice formula in a file named "example1.png"
If you need color, look at example 2:

> tex2im -b yellow -t blue examples/example2.tex

This time, the result is a color formula.

> tex2im "\sum_{i=0}^5 x_i^2"

generates a file named 'out.png', containing the formula

> tex2im *.tex

this is how multiple files can be processed.

Note that example4.tex needs the '-n' (no-formula) option when processed.

USAGE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

tex2im [options] inputfile(s)

The content of input file should be plain latex mathmode code! 
Alternatively, a string containing the latex code can be specified.

Options:
-v        show version
-h        show help
-o file   specifies output filename, 
          default is inputfile with new extension
-f expr   specifies output format, 
          possible examples: gif, jpg, tif......
          all formates supported by "convert" should work, 
          default: png
-r expr   specifies desired resolution in dpi, 
          possible examples: 100x100, 300x300, 200x150, 
          default is 150x150
-b expr   specifies the background color
          default: white
-t expr   specifies the text color
          default: black
-x file   file containing extra header lines of latex.
          default: ~/.tex2im_header
-n        no-formula mode (do not wrap in eqnarray* environment)
          default: off
-a        change status of antialiasing
          default is on for normal mode and
			 off for transparent mode
-z        transparent background
          default: off

For user specific default values, tex2im reads the file '.tex2imrc'
in your home-directorty. To change a value, put inside one or more 
of the following 7 commands:

   resolution="150x150"
   format="png"
   color1="white"
   color2="black"
   extra_header="~/.tex2im_header"
	trans=0
   aa=1

In the file '~/.tex2im_header', additional latex header lines can
be put, for example '\usepackage{amsmath}' or your own definitions.

The transparency implementation of imagemagic has some problems in
combination with antialiasing. Therefore, by default, antialiasing
is off in transparent mode. If you switch it on via the -a flag you
can expect pixels with something between background and text color
around the letters. This can look good if the background used in
tex2im and the one of your document are identical, but also very bad
if this is not the case. True antialising with transparency seems not
to be possible. Just play around a bit to find the optimal settings.

			 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use tex2im, you need latex and convert (part of image magic) installed.
For color support, also the latex color style is needed.
To install tex2im, download the archive, uncompress it, and place the contained script "tex2im" in a directory in your path and make it executable. In details:

> tar xzf tex2im.tar.gz
> mv tex2im/tex2im /path/of/your/choice
> chmod 755 /path/of/your/choice/tex2im
